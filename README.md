## üì¶ Requirements

- [Arduino IDE Portable](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- ESP32 Dev Board (e.g., ESP32-WROOM-32)  
- Micro USB Cable  
- BLE Keyboard Library ([ESP32-BLE-Keyboard](https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Keyboard))

## üîß Installation

1. **Install the ESP32 Board in Arduino IDE**  
   - Go to `File > Preferences`  
   - Add the following URL to *Additional Board Manager URLs*:  
     ```
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
     ```
   - Go to `Tools > Board > Boards Manager`, search `esp32` and install V.2.0.7

2. **Install BLE Keyboard Library**  
   - Download the library ZIP: [ESP32-BLE-Keyboard](https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Keyboard/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)  
   - In Arduino IDE, go to `Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library...`  
   - Select the downloaded ZIP file.

3. **Select the Board and Port**  
   - Go to `Tools > Board > ESP32 Dev Module`  
   - Select the correct COM port under `Tools > Port`

4. **Open and Edit the Code**  
   - Open `Ducky.ino` in Arduino IDE  
   - Customize the payload as needed 

5. **Upload to ESP32**  
   - Click ‚úÖ **Verify** then ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **Upload**  
   - Once uploaded, disconnect and power it externally

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Power the ESP32 device**  
   It will start broadcasting as a Bluetooth keyboard.

2. **Wait for the Victim to Pair**  
   On first use, the victim must accept the pairing.  
   After this, the ESP32 will auto-connect silently in the future.

3. **Payload Execution**  
   Once connected, the predefined script will automatically run and execute on the victim‚Äôs machine.
